# Hello there!

I see you took interest in this project, soooo... Hi! I will try to help you join us!

Anyone can help, young, old, freshman, veteran...!



## What we are doing here
This project is about a platform of testing for C programs, the initial focus is Mutation Testing. But, as we need to establish a lot of structures that could be useful for a lot of other testings, we are trying to be as broad as possible.

## How can you help?
Just by reading this you are already helping! Thank you! :)

If you want to talk about anything, just email us:

Guilherme <gttpinto@gmail.com>,
Giovani <giovaniortolanibarbosa@gmail.com>,
Marcelo <marcelo.tabacnik@>,
Renan <renanrdgsrodrigues@gmail.com>;


But, if you want to contribute with something more here are some things you can do:

**First, Just Fork it!**

Then if you want to:

* **Correct Something**:
   Just open an Issue or Email us, and if you already have corrected it just make a Pull Request and explain the correction so we can understand it!
 
* **Add Something**:
    Same as before, open an Issue or Email us about your idea, or just make a Pull Request explaining it!
 
* **Just Want to Help!**
    Try to look in the Issues if there is something you can do, should any doubt arises talk to us! We will try to keep the Issues updated with problems and their level of dificulty, so find something you can/want to do!
    
    Here are somethings that can help you in contributing: (IT'S NOT A NECESSITY TO KNOW, everyone is here to learn!!!)
    * C programming language
    * Distributed computing
    * Compilers
    * Testing Techniques
    
    There are some references in the bottom of this page for you!
    


### What now?
Ok, now we are still launching this project. Adding as much as we can before including any code!

After that what we will develop:

- A Padronized Testing Format for C
- A Automated Testing Plataform 
- A PreProcessing Unit for Dependencies
- A Mutator Process for Mutating Testing

We are establishing...
#### The Basis

Language: C

OS: Firstly GNU/Linux

For: C Developers

License: GNU GPL 3.0




### About Mutation Testing
  You can start here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing
  I will add others sources, but first I need to make some requests to some people...

### Some Literature about Testing in general and Mutation Testing
You can check these for some reference, they cover MUCH more than we are trying to do
